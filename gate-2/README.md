# Gate 2

As of 12/05, the second gateway started a 48 hour countdown leading to 10:07PM EST on Friday, the 7th. The gateway artwork has been updated to have a gif and to show clues for what will be in the gate. Theorists have found different clues relating to indie games (games that have been developed usually without the financial support of a publisher). Some theorists say that the morse code from all of the blinking translates to "THEONETRUEGOD", but people have argued if that means in a game or in real life.
